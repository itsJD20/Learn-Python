write a program to accept a list from user and print list the square of the elements of the list

print all elemnets in a list

Cumulative sum

HW

1. accept int list l1, l2, l3 from the user and print the final list which contains the sum of i th element of l1, l2, l3 .
2. Input a number n and define a list of size n with all elements as 0
n = 5
output:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
3. Write a function to accept a int list from the user and find factorial of each element

example:
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 6 24 120

Write a program to calculate the product of all elements in a list

example:
1 2 4 5
40
 #inputs
 #m =1
 #run forloop from (len(l))
 #m = l[i]*m
 #print m

Write find the square of cumulative sum of a list

example:
input = 1 2 3 4 5
cumulative sum = 1 3 6 10 15
ans = 1 9 36 100 225

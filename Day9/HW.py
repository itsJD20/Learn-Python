Q1>Write a program to add all numbers from 1 to n and find it's factorial

Q2> write a program to find the sum of all factorials from 1 to n
meaning : if n = 5 find 1!+2!+3!+4!+5!

1+(1*2)+(1*2*3)
1+(1+2)+(1+2+3+4+5+6)

Q1> write a program to find a to the power b

a to the power b = a*a*a*a*...*a b times

Q2> write a program to find sum of powers of a from 1 to n

Eg : a = 2 b = 4

a + a^2 + a^3 + a^4
